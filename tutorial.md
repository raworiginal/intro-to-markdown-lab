As a developer you will need optimize your system to 10x your productivity. Nothing prepares your for a session of l33tCode like a cup of l33tCoff33, and, in my opinion (which is objectively correct), the Chemex is the 10x brewer for the 10x developer.

## Required Tools

Like your dev environment, you need to gather the right tools for the job. To brew your l33tCoff33, you will need:

- a Chemex Brewer
- Chemex Coffee Filters
- an electric kettle
- a digital scale
  > ideally one that can measure to .1 of a gram.
- a timer
- medium-fine ground coffee
  > for the best result it should be freshly ground just before brewing.

## The Process

0. **Prep**: Gather your tools, bring your water to a boil, and grind your coffee. For this guide we will be using a ratio of 40g of coffee to 600g of water (This is a 1 to 15 ratio).

1. **Rinse the filter**: place a Chemex filter in your brewer. Pour a small amount a water into your brewer (just enough to wet the filter). Swirl the water in the brewer. Then discard the water.
2. **Add Coffee**: Pour your ground coffee into your brewer, and give the brewer a shake to level the grounds in the brewer.
3. **Tare your scale**: Place your brewer on your scale and zero out your scale.
4. **First Pour**: Start your timer. Then, pour your water in a spiral pattern from the center and moving out to the edge of the coffee bed. Pour until your scale reaches 120g.
   > Each pour is going to be follow the same pattern. Divide your total water amount into 5 equal portions (600 / 5 = 120). Pour a portion of your water, then wait until the end of a 30 second interval.
5. **Remaining Pours**: After 30 seconds has elaspsed from the start of your previous pour, start your next pour in same method as the first.

   > Below is table with the total time and total weight at each pour.
   > | Pour | Water Weight | Total Time |
   > |-- | -- | -- |
   > | 1 | 120g | 00:30 |
   > | 2 | 240g | 01:00 |
   > | 3 | 360g | 01:30 |
   > | 4 | 480g | 02:00 |
   > | 5 | 600g | 02:30 |

6. **Enjoy!**: Wait for the water to fully drain from the coffee, discard the ground coffee and filter.
